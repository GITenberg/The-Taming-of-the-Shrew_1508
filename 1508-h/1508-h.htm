<h4><b>SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc">
Enter <span class="charname">Hostess</span> and <span class="charname">Sly</span></p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll pheeze you, in faith.<br/>
</p>

<p>HOSTESS.<br/>
A pair of stocks, you rogue!<br/>
</p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
Y&rsquo;are a baggage; the Slys are no rogues; look in the
chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, <i>paucas
pallabris</i>; let the world slide. Sessa!</p>

<p>HOSTESS.<br/>
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?<br/>
</p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed
and warm thee.</p>

<p>HOSTESS.<br/>
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i>]</p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I&rsquo;ll answer him by law.
I&rsquo;ll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Lies down on the ground, and falls asleep.</i>]</p>

<p class="scenedesc">
Horns winded. Enter a <span class="charname">Lord</span> from hunting, with <span class="charname">Huntsmen</span> and <span class="charname">Servants.</span></p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;<br/>
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss&rsquo;d,<br/>
And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth&rsquo;d brach.<br/>
Saw&rsquo;st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good<br/>
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?<br/>
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST HUNTSMAN.<br/>
Why, Bellman is as good as he, my lord;<br/>
He cried upon it at the merest loss,<br/>
And twice today pick&rsquo;d out the dullest scent;<br/>
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,<br/>
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.<br/>
But sup them well, and look unto them all;<br/>
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST HUNTSMAN.<br/>
I will, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
[ <i>Sees Sly</i>.] What&rsquo;s here? One dead, or drunk?<br/>
See, doth he breathe?<br/>
</p>

<p>SECOND HUNTSMAN.<br/>
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm&rsquo;d with ale,<br/>
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!<br/>
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!<br/>
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.<br/>
What think you, if he were convey&rsquo;d to bed,<br/>
Wrapp&rsquo;d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,<br/>
A most delicious banquet by his bed,<br/>
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,<br/>
Would not the beggar then forget himself?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST HUNTSMAN.<br/>
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.<br/>
</p>

<p>SECOND HUNTSMAN.<br/>
It would seem strange unto him when he wak&rsquo;d.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.<br/>
Then take him up, and manage well the jest.<br/>
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,<br/>
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;<br/>
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,<br/>
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.<br/>
Procure me music ready when he wakes,<br/>
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;<br/>
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,<br/>
And with a low submissive reverence<br/>
Say &lsquo;What is it your honour will command?&rsquo;<br/>
Let one attend him with a silver basin<br/>
Full of rose-water and bestrew&rsquo;d with flowers;<br/>
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,<br/>
And say &lsquo;Will&rsquo;t please your lordship cool your hands?&rsquo;<br/>
Someone be ready with a costly suit,<br/>
And ask him what apparel he will wear;<br/>
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,<br/>
And that his lady mourns at his disease.<br/>
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;<br/>
And, when he says he is—say that he dreams,<br/>
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.<br/>
This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;<br/>
It will be pastime passing excellent,<br/>
If it be husbanded with modesty.<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST HUNTSMAN.<br/>
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,<br/>
As he shall think by our true diligence,<br/>
He is no less than what we say he is.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Take him up gently, and to bed with him,<br/>
And each one to his office when he wakes.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="charname">Sly</span> <i>is bourne out. A trumpet sounds.</i>]</p>

<p>Sirrah, go see what trumpet &rsquo;tis that sounds:</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="charname">Servant</span>.]</p>

<p>Belike some noble gentleman that means,<br/>
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.<br/>
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">
Re-enter <span class="charname">Servant.</span></p>

<p>How now! who is it?</p>

<p>SERVANT.<br/>
An it please your honour, players<br/>
That offer service to your lordship.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Bid them come near.<br/>
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">
Enter <span class="charname">Players.</span></p>

<p>Now, fellows, you are welcome.</p>

<p>PLAYERS.<br/>
We thank your honour.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER.<br/>
So please your lordship to accept our duty.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
With all my heart. This fellow I remember<br/>
Since once he play&rsquo;d a farmer&rsquo;s eldest son;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas where you woo&rsquo;d the gentlewoman so well.<br/>
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part<br/>
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform&rsquo;d.<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER.<br/>
I think &rsquo;twas Soto that your honour means.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.<br/>
Well, you are come to me in happy time,<br/>
The rather for I have some sport in hand<br/>
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.<br/>
There is a lord will hear you play tonight;<br/>
But I am doubtful of your modesties,<br/>
Lest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,—<br/>
For yet his honour never heard a play,—<br/>
You break into some merry passion<br/>
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,<br/>
If you should smile, he grows impatient.<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER.<br/>
Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,<br/>
Were he the veriest antick in the world.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,<br/>
And give them friendly welcome everyone:<br/>
Let them want nothing that my house affords.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit one with the <span class="charname">Players.</span></i>]</p>

<p>Sirrah, go you to Barthol&rsquo;mew my page,<br/>
And see him dress&rsquo;d in all suits like a lady;<br/>
That done, conduct him to the drunkard&rsquo;s chamber,<br/>
And call him &lsquo;madam,&rsquo; do him obeisance.<br/>
Tell him from me—as he will win my love,—<br/>
He bear himself with honourable action,<br/>
Such as he hath observ&rsquo;d in noble ladies<br/>
Unto their lords, by them accomplished;<br/>
Such duty to the drunkard let him do,<br/>
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,<br/>
And say &lsquo;What is&rsquo;t your honour will command,<br/>
Wherein your lady and your humble wife<br/>
May show her duty and make known her love?&rsquo;<br/>
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,<br/>
And with declining head into his bosom,<br/>
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy&rsquo;d<br/>
To see her noble lord restor&rsquo;d to health,<br/>
Who for this seven years hath esteemed him<br/>
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.<br/>
And if the boy have not a woman&rsquo;s gift<br/>
To rain a shower of commanded tears,<br/>
An onion will do well for such a shift,<br/>
Which, in a napkin being close convey&rsquo;d,<br/>
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.<br/>
See this dispatch&rsquo;d with all the haste thou canst;<br/>
Anon I&rsquo;ll give thee more instructions.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit <span class="charname">Servant.</span></i>]</p>

<p>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,<br/>
Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman;<br/>
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband;<br/>
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter<br/>
When they do homage to this simple peasant.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll in to counsel them; haply my presence<br/>
May well abate the over-merry spleen,<br/>
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.<br/>

<h4><b>SCENE II. A bedchamber in the LORD&rsquo;S house.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc">
<span class="charname">Sly</span> is discovered in a rich nightgown, with <span class="charname">Attendants</span>: some with
apparel, basin, ewer, and other appurtenances; and <span class="charname">Lord</span>, dressed
like a servant.</p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
For God&rsquo;s sake! a pot of small ale.<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST SERVANT.<br/>
Will&rsquo;t please your lordship drink a cup of sack?<br/>
</p>

<p>SECOND SERVANT.<br/>
Will&rsquo;t please your honour taste of these conserves?<br/>
</p>

<p>THIRD SERVANT.<br/>
What raiment will your honour wear today?<br/>
</p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
I am Christophero Sly; call not me honour nor lordship. I
ne&rsquo;er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves,
give me conserves of beef. Ne&rsquo;er ask me what raiment I&rsquo;ll wear,
for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than
legs, nor no more shoes than feet: nay, sometime more feet than
shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the over-leather.</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!<br/>
O, that a mighty man of such descent,<br/>
Of such possessions, and so high esteem,<br/>
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!<br/>
</p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
What! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old
Sly&rsquo;s son of Burton-heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a
cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present
profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of
Wincot, if she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence on
the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in
Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. Here&rsquo;s—</p>

<p>THIRD SERVANT.<br/>
O! this it is that makes your lady mourn.<br/>
</p>

<p>SECOND SERVANT.<br/>
O! this is it that makes your servants droop.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,<br/>
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.<br/>
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,<br/>
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,<br/>
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.<br/>
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,<br/>
Each in his office ready at thy beck:<br/>
Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Music.</i>]</p>

<p>And twenty caged nightingales do sing:<br/>
Or wilt thou sleep? We&rsquo;ll have thee to a couch<br/>
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed<br/>
On purpose trimm&rsquo;d up for Semiramis.<br/>
Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground:<br/>
Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp&rsquo;d,<br/>
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.<br/>
Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar<br/>
Above the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?<br/>
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them<br/>
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST SERVANT.<br/>
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift<br/>
As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.<br/>
</p>

<p>SECOND SERVANT.<br/>
Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight<br/>
Adonis painted by a running brook,<br/>
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,<br/>
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath<br/>
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
We&rsquo;ll show thee Io as she was a maid<br/>
And how she was beguiled and surpris&rsquo;d,<br/>
As lively painted as the deed was done.<br/>
</p>

<p>THIRD SERVANT.<br/>
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,<br/>
Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds<br/>
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,<br/>
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:<br/>
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful<br/>
Than any woman in this waning age.<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST SERVANT.<br/>
And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee<br/>
Like envious floods o&rsquo;er-run her lovely face,<br/>
She was the fairest creature in the world;<br/>
And yet she is inferior to none.<br/>
</p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?<br/>
Or do I dream? Or have I dream&rsquo;d till now?<br/>
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;<br/>
I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things:<br/>
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed;<br/>
And not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly.<br/>
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;<br/>
And once again, a pot o&rsquo; the smallest ale.<br/>
</p>

<p>SECOND SERVANT.<br/>
Will&rsquo;t please your mightiness to wash your hands?<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Servants present a ewer, basin and napkin.</i>]</p>

<p>O, how we joy to see your wit restor&rsquo;d!<br/>
O, that once more you knew but what you are!<br/>
These fifteen years you have been in a dream,<br/>
Or, when you wak&rsquo;d, so wak&rsquo;d as if you slept.<br/>
</p>

<p>SLY.<br/>
These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.<br/>
But did I never speak of all that time?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST SERVANT.<br/>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Tranio, since for the great desire I had<br/>
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,<br/>
I am arriv&rsquo;d for fruitful Lombardy,<br/>
The pleasant garden of great Italy,<br/>
And by my father&rsquo;s love and leave am arm&rsquo;d<br/>
With his good will and thy good company,<br/>
My trusty servant well approv&rsquo;d in all,<br/>
Here let us breathe, and haply institute<br/>
A course of learning and ingenious studies.<br/>
Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,<br/>
Gave me my being and my father first,<br/>
A merchant of great traffic through the world,<br/>
Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.<br/>
Vincentio&rsquo;s son, brought up in Florence,<br/>
It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv&rsquo;d,<br/>
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:<br/>
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,<br/>
Virtue and that part of philosophy<br/>
Will I apply that treats of happiness<br/>
By virtue specially to be achiev&rsquo;d.<br/>
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left<br/>
And am to Padua come as he that leaves<br/>
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,<br/>
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
<i>Mi perdonato</i>, gentle master mine;<br/>
I am in all affected as yourself;<br/>
Glad that you thus continue your resolve<br/>
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.<br/>
Only, good master, while we do admire<br/>
This virtue and this moral discipline,<br/>
Let&rsquo;s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;<br/>
Or so devote to Aristotle&rsquo;s checks<br/>
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur&rsquo;d.<br/>
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,<br/>
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;<br/>
Music and poesy use to quicken you;<br/>
The mathematics and the metaphysics,<br/>
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you:<br/>
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta&rsquo;en;<br/>
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.<br/>
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,<br/>
We could at once put us in readiness,<br/>
And take a lodging fit to entertain<br/>
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.<br/>

You may go to the devil&rsquo;s dam: your gifts are so good
here&rsquo;s none will hold you. Their love is not so great,
Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly
out; our cake&rsquo;s dough on both sides. Farewell: yet, for the love I
bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to
teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her
father.</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though
the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon
advice, it toucheth us both,—that we may yet again have access to
our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca&rsquo;s love,—to labour
and effect one thing specially.</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
What&rsquo;s that, I pray?<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
A husband! a devil.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
I say, a husband.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her
father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to
hell?</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to
endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the
world, and a man could light on them, would take her with all
faults, and money enough.</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this
condition: to be whipp&rsquo;d at the high cross every morning.</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Faith, as you say, there&rsquo;s small choice in rotten
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it
shall be so far forth friendly maintained, till by helping
Baptista&rsquo;s eldest daughter to a husband, we set his youngest free
for a husband, and then have to&rsquo;t afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you,
Signior Gremio?</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in
Padua to begin his wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed
her, and bed her, and rid the house of her. Come on.

I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible<br/>
That love should of a sudden take such hold?<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
O Tranio! till I found it to be true,<br/>
I never thought it possible or likely;<br/>
But see, while idly I stood looking on,<br/>
I found the effect of love in idleness;<br/>
And now in plainness do confess to thee,<br/>
That art to me as secret and as dear<br/>
As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was,<br/>
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,<br/>
If I achieve not this young modest girl.<br/>
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst:<br/>
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Master, it is no time to chide you now;<br/>
Affection is not rated from the heart:<br/>
If love have touch&rsquo;d you, nought remains but so:<br/>
<i>Redime te captum quam queas minimo.</i><br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Gramercies, lad; go forward; this contents;<br/>
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel&rsquo;s sound.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Master, you look&rsquo;d so longly on the maid.<br/>
Perhaps you mark&rsquo;d not what&rsquo;s the pith of all.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,<br/>
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,<br/>
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,<br/>
When with his knees he kiss&rsquo;d the Cretan strand.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Saw you no more? mark&rsquo;d you not how her sister<br/>
Began to scold and raise up such a storm<br/>
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,<br/>
And with her breath she did perfume the air;<br/>
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Nay, then, &rsquo;tis time to stir him from his trance.<br/>
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,<br/>
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:<br/>
Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd,<br/>
That till the father rid his hands of her,<br/>
Master, your love must live a maid at home;<br/>
And therefore has he closely mew&rsquo;d her up,<br/>
Because she will not be annoy&rsquo;d with suitors.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father&rsquo;s he!<br/>
But art thou not advis&rsquo;d he took some care<br/>
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now &rsquo;tis plotted.<br/>

</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Not possible; for who shall bear your part<br/>

Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends;<br/>
Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?<br/>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
<i>Basta</i>, content thee, for I have it full.<br/>
We have not yet been seen in any house,<br/>
Nor can we be distinguish&rsquo;d by our faces<br/>
For man or master: then it follows thus:<br/>
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,<br/>
Keep house and port and servants, as I should;<br/>
I will some other be; some Florentine,<br/>
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis hatch&rsquo;d, and shall be so: Tranio, at once<br/>
Uncase thee; take my colour&rsquo;d hat and cloak.<br/>

Thou&rsquo;dst thank me but a little for my counsel;<br/>
And yet I&rsquo;ll promise thee she shall be rich,<br/>
And very rich: but th&rsquo;art too much my friend,<br/>
And I&rsquo;ll not wish thee to her.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Signior Hortensio, &rsquo;twixt such friends as we<br/>
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know<br/>
One rich enough to be Petruchio&rsquo;s wife,<br/>
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,<br/>
Be she as foul as was Florentius&rsquo; love,<br/>
As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd<br/>
As Socrates&rsquo; Xanthippe or a worse,<br/>
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,<br/>
Affection&rsquo;s edge in me, were she as rough<br/>
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:<br/>
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;<br/>
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why,
give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an
aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne&rsquo;er a tooth in her head, though
she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses: why, nothing
comes amiss, so money comes withal.</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Petruchio, since we are stepp&rsquo;d thus far in,<br/>
I will continue that I broach&rsquo;d in jest.<br/>
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife<br/>
With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;<br/>
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:<br/>
Her only fault,—and that is faults enough,—<br/>
Is, that she is intolerable curst,<br/>
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,<br/>
That, were my state far worser than it is,<br/>
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Hortensio, peace! thou know&rsquo;st not gold&rsquo;s effect:<br/>
Tell me her father&rsquo;s name, and &rsquo;tis enough;<br/>
For I will board her, though she chide as loud<br/>
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Her father is Baptista Minola,<br/>
An affable and courteous gentleman;<br/>
Her name is Katherina Minola,<br/>
Renown&rsquo;d in Padua for her scolding tongue.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
I know her father, though I know not her;<br/>
And he knew my deceased father well.<br/>
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;<br/>
And therefore let me be thus bold with you,<br/>
To give you over at this first encounter,<br/>
Unless you will accompany me thither.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O&rsquo; my
word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding
would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a
score knaves or so; why, that&rsquo;s nothing; and he begin once, he&rsquo;ll
rail in his rope-tricks. I&rsquo;ll tell you what, sir, and she stand him
but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure
her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a
cat. You know him not, sir.</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,<br/>
For in Baptista&rsquo;s keep my treasure is:<br/>
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,<br/>
His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,<br/>
And her withholds from me and other more,<br/>
Suitors to her and rivals in my love;<br/>
Supposing it a thing impossible,<br/>
For those defects I have before rehears&rsquo;d,<br/>
That ever Katherina will be woo&rsquo;d:<br/>
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta&rsquo;en,<br/>
That none shall have access unto Bianca<br/>
Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Katherine the curst!<br/>
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,<br/>
And offer me disguis&rsquo;d in sober robes,<br/>
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster<br/>
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;<br/>
That so I may, by this device at least<br/>
Have leave and leisure to make love to her,<br/>
And unsuspected court her by herself.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Here&rsquo;s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the
young folks lay their heads together!</p>

<p class="scenedesc">
Enter <span class="charname">Gremio</span> and <span class="charname">Lucentio</span> disguised, with books under his arm.</p>

<p>Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio,
stand by awhile.</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
A proper stripling, and an amorous!<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
O! very well; I have perus&rsquo;d the note.<br/>
Hark you, sir; I&rsquo;ll have them very fairly bound:<br/>
All books of love, see that at any hand,<br/>
And see you read no other lectures to her.<br/>
You understand me. Over and beside<br/>
Signior Baptista&rsquo;s liberality,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too,<br/>
And let me have them very well perfum&rsquo;d;<br/>
For she is sweeter than perfume itself<br/>
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er I read to her, I&rsquo;ll plead for you,<br/>
As for my patron, stand you so assur&rsquo;d,<br/>
As firmly as yourself were still in place;<br/>
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words<br/>
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
O! this learning, what a thing it is.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
O! this woodcock, what an ass it is.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Peace, sirrah!<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio!<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.<br/>
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.<br/>
I promis&rsquo;d to enquire carefully<br/>
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;<br/>
And by good fortune I have lighted well<br/>
On this young man; for learning and behaviour<br/>
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry<br/>
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis well; and I have met a gentleman<br/>
Hath promis&rsquo;d me to help me to another,<br/>
A fine musician to instruct our mistress:<br/>
So shall I no whit be behind in duty<br/>
To fair Bianca, so belov&rsquo;d of me.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Belov&rsquo;d of me, and that my deeds shall prove.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] And that his bags shall prove.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Gremio, &rsquo;tis now no time to vent our love:<br/>
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll tell you news indifferent good for either.<br/>
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,<br/>
Upon agreement from us to his liking,<br/>
Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;<br/>
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
So said, so done, is well.<br/>
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
I know she is an irksome brawling scold;<br/>
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
No, say&rsquo;st me so, friend? What countryman?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Born in Verona, old Antonio&rsquo;s son.<br/>
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;<br/>
And I do hope good days and long to see.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!<br/>
But if you have a stomach, to&rsquo;t a God&rsquo;s name;<br/>
You shall have me assisting you in all.<br/>
But will you woo this wild-cat?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Will I live?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Will he woo her? Ay, or I&rsquo;ll hang her.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Why came I hither but to that intent?<br/>
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?<br/>
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?<br/>
Have I not heard the sea, puff&rsquo;d up with winds,<br/>
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?<br/>
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,<br/>
And heaven&rsquo;s artillery thunder in the skies?<br/>
Have I not in a pitched battle heard<br/>
Loud &rsquo;larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets&rsquo; clang?<br/>
And do you tell me of a woman&rsquo;s tongue,<br/>
That gives not half so great a blow to hear<br/>
As will a chestnut in a farmer&rsquo;s fire?<br/>
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
[<i>Aside</i>] For he fears none.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Hortensio, hark:<br/>
This gentleman is happily arriv&rsquo;d,<br/>
My mind presumes, for his own good and yours.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
I promis&rsquo;d we would be contributors,<br/>
And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe&rsquo;er.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
And so we will, provided that he win her.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.<br/>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,<br/>
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way<br/>
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
He that has the two fair daughters; is&rsquo;t he you mean?<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Even he, Biondello!<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Hark you, sir, you mean not her to—<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let&rsquo;s away.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
[<i>Aside</i>]  Well begun, Tranio.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Sir, a word ere you go.<br/>
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
No; if without more words you will get you hence.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free<br/>
For me as for you?<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
But so is not she.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
For what reason, I beseech you?<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
For this reason, if you&rsquo;ll know,<br/>
That she&rsquo;s the choice love of Signior Gremio.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
That she&rsquo;s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,<br/>
Do me this right; hear me with patience.<br/>
Baptista is a noble gentleman,<br/>
To whom my father is not all unknown;<br/>
And were his daughter fairer than she is,<br/>
She may more suitors have, and me for one.<br/>
Fair Leda&rsquo;s daughter had a thousand wooers;<br/>
Then well one more may fair Bianca have;<br/>
And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,<br/>
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
What, this gentleman will out-talk us all.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Sir, give him head; I know he&rsquo;ll prove a jade.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,<br/>
Did you yet ever see Baptista&rsquo;s daughter?<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,<br/>
The one as famous for a scolding tongue<br/>
As is the other for beauteous modesty.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Sir, sir, the first&rsquo;s for me; let her go by.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,<br/>
And let it be more than Alcides&rsquo; twelve.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:<br/>
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,<br/>
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,<br/>
And will not promise her to any man<br/>
Until the elder sister first be wed;<br/>
The younger then is free, and not before.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
If it be so, sir, that you are the man<br/>
Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;<br/>
And if you break the ice, and do this feat,<br/>
Achieve the elder, set the younger free<br/>
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her<br/>
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;<br/>
And since you do profess to be a suitor,<br/>
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,<br/>
To whom we all rest generally beholding.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,<br/>
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,<br/>
And quaff carouses to our mistress&rsquo; health;<br/>
And do as adversaries do in law,<br/>
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO, BIONDELLO.<br/>
O excellent motion! Fellows, let&rsquo;s be gone.<br/>
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,<br/>
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;<br/>
That I disdain; but for these other gawds,<br/>
Unbind my hands, I&rsquo;ll pull them off myself,<br/>
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;<br/>
Or what you will command me will I do,<br/>
So well I know my duty to my elders.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell<br/>
Whom thou lov&rsquo;st best: see thou dissemble not.<br/>
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive<br/>
I never yet beheld that special face<br/>
Which I could fancy more than any other.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Minion, thou liest. Is&rsquo;t not Hortensio?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
If you affect him, sister, here I swear<br/>
I&rsquo;ll plead for you myself but you shall have him.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
O! then, belike, you fancy riches more:<br/>
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.<br/>
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Is it for him you do envy me so?<br/>
Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive<br/>
You have but jested with me all this while:<br/>
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.<br/>
</p>

Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.<br/>
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.<br/>
For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,<br/>
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne&rsquo;er wrong thee?<br/>
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?<br/>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Her silence flouts me, and I&rsquo;ll be reveng&rsquo;d.<br/>

She is your treasure, she must have a husband;<br/>
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,<br/>

Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,<br/>
Am bold to show myself a forward guest<br/>
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness<br/>
Of that report which I so oft have heard.<br/>
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,<br/>
I do present you with a man of mine,<br/>

<p class="right">[<i>Presenting <span class="charname">Hortensio.</span></i>]</p>

<p>Cunning in music and the mathematics,<br/>
To instruct her fully in those sciences,<br/>

His name is Licio, born in Mantua.<br/>

Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.<br/>
Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?<br/>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Petruchio is my name, Antonio&rsquo;s son;<br/>
A man well known throughout all Italy.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,<br/>
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too.<br/>
Backare! you are marvellous forward.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To
express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly
beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young
scholar,</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Presenting <span class="charname">Lucentio.</span></i>]</p>

<p>that has been long studying at Rheims; as cunning in Greek,
Latin, and other languages, as the other in music and
mathematics. His name is Cambio; pray accept his service.</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio; welcome, good Cambio.
[<i>To Tranio.</i>]
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger.
May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,<br/>
That, being a stranger in this city here,<br/>
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,<br/>
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.<br/>
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,<br/>
In the preferment of the eldest sister.<br/>
This liberty is all that I request,<br/>
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,<br/>
I may have welcome &rsquo;mongst the rest that woo,<br/>
And free access and favour as the rest:<br/>
And, toward the education of your daughters,<br/>
I here bestow a simple instrument,<br/>
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:<br/>
If you accept them, then their worth is great.<br/>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,<br/>
And every day I cannot come to woo.<br/>
You knew my father well, and in him me,<br/>
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,<br/>
Which I have bettered rather than decreas&rsquo;d:<br/>
Then tell me, if I get your daughter&rsquo;s love,<br/>
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
After my death, the one half of my lands,<br/>
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
And, for that dowry, I&rsquo;ll assure her of<br/>
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,<br/>
In all my lands and leases whatsoever.<br/>
Let specialities be therefore drawn between us,<br/>
That covenants may be kept on either hand.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain&rsquo;d,<br/>
That is, her love; for that is all in all.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,<br/>
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;<br/>
And where two raging fires meet together,<br/>
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:<br/>
Though little fire grows great with little wind,<br/>
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;<br/>
So I to her, and so she yields to me;<br/>
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!<br/>
But be thou arm&rsquo;d for some unhappy words.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
I think she&rsquo;ll sooner prove a soldier:<br/>
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.<br/>
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,<br/>
And bow&rsquo;d her hand to teach her fingering;<br/>
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,<br/>
&rsquo;Frets, call you these?&rsquo; quoth she &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
fume with them&rsquo;;<br/>
And with that word she struck me on the head,<br/>
And through the instrument my pate made way;<br/>
And there I stood amazed for a while,<br/>
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;<br/>
While she did call me rascal fiddler,<br/>
And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,<br/>
As had she studied to misuse me so.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench!<br/>
I love her ten times more than e&rsquo;er I did:<br/>
O! how I long to have some chat with her!<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
[<i>To Hortensio</i>.] Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;<br/>
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;<br/>
She&rsquo;s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.<br/>
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,<br/>
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
I pray you do.<br/>

<p class="right">[<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Baptista, Gremio, Tranio</span> and <span class="charname">Hortensio.</span></i>]</p>

<p>I will attend her here,<br/>
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.<br/>
Say that she rail; why, then I&rsquo;ll tell her plain<br/>
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:<br/>
Say that she frown; I&rsquo;ll say she looks as clear<br/>
As morning roses newly wash&rsquo;d with dew:<br/>
Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;<br/>
Then I&rsquo;ll commend her volubility,<br/>
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:<br/>
If she do bid me pack, I&rsquo;ll give her thanks,<br/>
As though she bid me stay by her a week:<br/>
If she deny to wed, I&rsquo;ll crave the day<br/>
When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.<br/>

<p>Good morrow, Kate; for that&rsquo;s your name, I hear.</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:<br/>
They call me Katherine that do talk of me.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
You lie, in faith, for you are call&rsquo;d plain Kate,<br/>
And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;<br/>
But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,<br/>
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,<br/>
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,<br/>
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;<br/>
Hearing thy mildness prais&rsquo;d in every town,<br/>
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,—<br/>
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,—<br/>
Myself am mov&rsquo;d to woo thee for my wife.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Mov&rsquo;d! in good time: let him that mov&rsquo;d you hither<br/>
Remove you hence. I knew you at the first,<br/>
You were a moveable.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Why, what&rsquo;s a moveable?<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
A joint-stool.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Women are made to bear, and so are you.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
No such jade as bear you, if me you mean.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;<br/>
For, knowing thee to be but young and light,—<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;<br/>
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Should be! should buz!<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Well ta&rsquo;en, and like a buzzard.
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
O, slow-wing&rsquo;d turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Come, come, you wasp; i&rsquo; faith, you are too angry.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
My remedy is then to pluck it out.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?<br/>
In his tail.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
In his tongue.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Whose tongue?</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
What! with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,<br/>
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
That I&rsquo;ll try.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Striking him.</i>]</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
I swear I&rsquo;ll cuff you if you strike again.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
So may you lose your arms:<br/>
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;<br/>
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
A herald, Kate? O! put me in thy books.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
What is your crest? a coxcomb?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
It is my fashion when I see a crab.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Why, here&rsquo;s no crab, and therefore look not sour.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
There is, there is.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Then show it me.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Had I a glass I would.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
What, you mean my face?<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Well aim&rsquo;d of such a young one.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Yet you are wither&rsquo;d.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis with cares.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
I care not.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth, you &rsquo;scape not so.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.<br/>
&rsquo;Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,<br/>
And now I find report a very liar;<br/>
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,<br/>
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers.<br/>
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,<br/>
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,<br/>
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;<br/>
But thou with mildness entertain&rsquo;st thy wooers;<br/>
With gentle conference, soft and affable.<br/>
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?<br/>
O sland&rsquo;rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig<br/>
Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue<br/>
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.<br/>
O! let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Go, fool, and whom thou keep&rsquo;st command.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Did ever Dian so become a grove<br/>
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?<br/>
O! be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,<br/>
And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Where did you study all this goodly speech?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
A witty mother! witless else her son.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Am I not wise?<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Yes; keep you warm.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed;<br/>
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,<br/>
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented<br/>
That you shall be my wife your dowry &rsquo;greed on;<br/>
And will you, nill you, I will marry you.<br/>
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;<br/>
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,—<br/>
Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,—<br/>
Thou must be married to no man but me;<br/>
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,<br/>
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate<br/>
Conformable as other household Kates.<br/>

<p>
Here comes your father. Never make denial;<br/>
I must and will have Katherine to my wife.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
How but well, sir? how but well?<br/>
It were impossible I should speed amiss.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Call you me daughter? Now I promise you<br/>
You have show&rsquo;d a tender fatherly regard<br/>
To wish me wed to one half lunatic,<br/>
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,<br/>
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Father, &rsquo;tis thus: yourself and all the world<br/>
That talk&rsquo;d of her have talk&rsquo;d amiss of her:<br/>
If she be curst, it is for policy,<br/>
For she&rsquo;s not froward, but modest as the dove;<br/>
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;<br/>
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,<br/>
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity;<br/>
And to conclude, we have &rsquo;greed so well together<br/>
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll see thee hang&rsquo;d on Sunday first.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Hark, Petruchio; she says she&rsquo;ll see thee hang&rsquo;d first.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;<br/>
If she and I be pleas&rsquo;d, what&rsquo;s that to you?<br/>
&rsquo;Tis bargain&rsquo;d &rsquo;twixt us twain, being alone,<br/>
That she shall still be curst in company.<br/>
I tell you, &rsquo;tis incredible to believe<br/>
How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate<br/>
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss<br/>
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,<br/>
That in a twink she won me to her love.<br/>
O! you are novices: &rsquo;tis a world to see,<br/>
How tame, when men and women are alone,<br/>
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.<br/>
Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,<br/>
To buy apparel &rsquo;gainst the wedding-day.<br/>
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;<br/>
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
I know not what to say; but give me your hands.<br/>
God send you joy, Petruchio! &rsquo;Tis a match.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO, TRANIO.<br/>
Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.<br/>
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;<br/>
We will have rings and things, and fine array;<br/>
And kiss me, Kate; we will be married o&rsquo; Sunday.<br/>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Was ever match clapp&rsquo;d up so suddenly?<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant&rsquo;s part,<br/>
And venture madly on a desperate mart.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
&rsquo;Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;<br/>
&rsquo;Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.<br/>
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:<br/>
Now is the day we long have looked for;<br/>
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
And I am one that love Bianca more<br/>
Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
But thine doth fry.<br/>
Skipper, stand back; &rsquo;tis age that nourisheth.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
But youth in ladies&rsquo; eyes that flourisheth.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Content you, gentlemen; I&rsquo;ll compound this strife:<br/>
&rsquo;Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both<br/>
That can assure my daughter greatest dower<br/>
Shall have my Bianca&rsquo;s love.<br/>
Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
First, as you know, my house within the city<br/>
Is richly furnished with plate and gold:<br/>
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;<br/>
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;<br/>
In ivory coffers I have stuff&rsquo;d my crowns;<br/>
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,<br/>
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,<br/>
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss&rsquo;d with pearl,<br/>
Valance of Venice gold in needlework;<br/>
Pewter and brass, and all things that belong<br/>
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm<br/>
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,<br/>
Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,<br/>
And all things answerable to this portion.<br/>
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;<br/>
And if I die tomorrow this is hers,<br/>
If whilst I live she will be only mine.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
That &lsquo;only&rsquo; came well in. Sir, list to me:<br/>
I am my father&rsquo;s heir and only son;<br/>
If I may have your daughter to my wife,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll leave her houses three or four as good<br/>
Within rich Pisa&rsquo;s walls as anyone<br/>
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;<br/>
Besides two thousand ducats by the year<br/>
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.<br/>
What, have I pinch&rsquo;d you, Signior Gremio?<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!<br/>
My land amounts not to so much in all:<br/>
That she shall have, besides an argosy<br/>
That now is lying in Marseilles&rsquo; road.<br/>
What, have I chok&rsquo;d you with an argosy?<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Gremio, &rsquo;tis known my father hath no less<br/>
Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,<br/>
And twelve tight galleys; these I will assure her,<br/>
And twice as much, whate&rsquo;er thou offer&rsquo;st next.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Nay, I have offer&rsquo;d all; I have no more;<br/>
And she can have no more than all I have;<br/>
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,<br/>
By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
I must confess your offer is the best;<br/>
And let your father make her the assurance,<br/>
She is your own; else, you must pardon me;<br/>
If you should die before him, where&rsquo;s her dower?<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
That&rsquo;s but a cavil; he is old, I young.<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
And may not young men die as well as old?<br/>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Well, gentlemen,<br/>
I am thus resolv&rsquo;d. On Sunday next, you know,<br/>
My daughter Katherine is to be married;<br/>
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca<br/>
Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;<br/>
If not, to Signior Gremio.<br/>
And so I take my leave, and thank you both.<br/>

But, wrangling pedant, this is<br/>
The patroness of heavenly harmony:<br/>
Then give me leave to have prerogative;<br/>
And when in music we have spent an hour,<br/>
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Preposterous ass, that never read so far<br/>
To know the cause why music was ordain&rsquo;d!<br/>
Was it not to refresh the mind of man<br/>
After his studies or his usual pain?<br/>
Then give me leave to read philosophy,<br/>
And while I pause serve in your harmony.<br/>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.<br/>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,<br/>
To strive for that which resteth in my choice.<br/>
I am no breeching scholar in the schools,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll not be tied to hours nor &rsquo;pointed times,<br/>
But learn my lessons as I please myself.<br/>
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down;<br/>
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;<br/>
His lecture will be done ere you have tun&rsquo;d.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
You&rsquo;ll leave his lecture when I am in tune?<br/>

<p class="right">[<i>Retires.</i>]</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
That will be never: tune your instrument.<br/>

Where left we last?<br/>

Here, madam:—<br/>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Construe them.<br/>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
<i>Hic ibat</i>, as I told you before, <i>Simois</i>, I am Lucentio, <i>hic
est</i>, son unto Vincentio of Pisa, <i>Sigeia tellus</i>, disguised thus
to get your love, <i>Hic steterat</i>, and that Lucentio that comes
a-wooing, <i>Priami</i>, is my man Tranio, <i>regia</i>, bearing my port,
<i>celsa senis</i>, that we might beguile the old pantaloon.</p>

<p>HORTENSIO. [<i>Returning.</i>]<br/>
Madam, my instrument&rsquo;s in tune.<br/>

<p>O fie! the treble jars.</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.<br/>
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Now let me see if I can construe it: <i>Hic ibat Simois</i>, I
know you not; <i>hic est Sigeia tellus</i>, I trust you not; <i>Hic

All but the base.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
The base is right; &rsquo;tis the base knave that jars.<br/>
[<i>Aside</i>] How fiery and forward our pedant is!<br/>
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:<br/>
Pedascule, I&rsquo;ll watch you better yet.<br/>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Mistrust it not; for sure, Æacides<br/>
Was Ajax, call&rsquo;d so from his grandfather.<br/>
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,<br/>
I should be arguing still upon that doubt;<br/>
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.<br/>
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,<br/>
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
[<i>To Lucentio</i>] You may go walk and give me leave a while;<br/>
My lessons make no music in three parts.<br/>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,<br/>
[<i>Aside</i>] And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv&rsquo;d,<br/>
Our fine musician groweth amorous.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Madam, before you touch the instrument,<br/>
To learn the order of my fingering,<br/>
I must begin with rudiments of art;<br/>
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,<br/>
More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,<br/>
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:<br/>

<p>BAPTISTA.  [<i>To Tranio</i>.]<br/>
Signior Lucentio, this is the &rsquo;pointed day<br/>
That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,<br/>
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.<br/>
What will be said? What mockery will it be<br/>
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends<br/>
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!<br/>
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc&rsquo;d<br/>
To give my hand, oppos&rsquo;d against my heart,<br/>
Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen;<br/>
Who woo&rsquo;d in haste and means to wed at leisure.<br/>
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,<br/>
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;<br/>
And to be noted for a merry man,<br/>
He&rsquo;ll woo a thousand, &rsquo;point the day of marriage,<br/>
Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns;<br/>
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo&rsquo;d.<br/>
Now must the world point at poor Katherine,<br/>
And say &lsquo;Lo! there is mad Petruchio&rsquo;s wife,<br/>
If it would please him come and marry her.&rsquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.<br/>
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,<br/>
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:<br/>
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;<br/>
Though he be merry, yet withal he&rsquo;s honest.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Would Katherine had never seen him though!<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit weeping, followed by <span class="charname">Bianca</span> and others.</i>]</p>

Is it new and old too? How may that be?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio&rsquo;s coming?<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Is he come?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
Why, no, sir.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
What then?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
He is coming.<br/>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
But say, what to thine old news?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
Why, Petruchio is coming, in a new hat and an old
jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turned; a pair of boots
that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another laced; an old
rusty sword ta&rsquo;en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt,
and chapeless; with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possessed
with the glanders and like to mose in the chine; troubled with
the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped
with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed in
the back and shoulder-shotten; near-legged before, and with a
half-checked bit, and a head-stall of sheep&rsquo;s leather, which,
being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often
burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times pieced,
and a woman&rsquo;s crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her
name fairly set down in studs, and here and there pieced with
pack-thread.</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Who comes with him?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
O, sir! his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like
the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose
on the other, gartered with a red and blue list; an old hat, and
the humour of forty fancies prick&rsquo;d in&rsquo;t for a feather: a
monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman&rsquo;s lackey.</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;<br/>
Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean-apparell&rsquo;d.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
I am glad he&rsquo;s come, howsoe&rsquo;er he comes.<br/>

Her father&rsquo;s liking; which to bring to pass,<br/>

I&rsquo;ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest<br/>
Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,<br/>
&rsquo;Ay, by gogs-wouns&rsquo; quoth he, and swore so loud<br/>
That, all amaz&rsquo;d, the priest let fall the book;<br/>
And as he stoop&rsquo;d again to take it up,<br/>
The mad-brain&rsquo;d bridegroom took him such a cuff<br/>
That down fell priest and book, and book and priest:<br/>
&lsquo;Now take them up,&rsquo; quoth he &lsquo;if any list.&rsquo;<br/>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
What said the wench, when he rose again?<br/>
</p>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Trembled and shook, for why, he stamp&rsquo;d and swore<br/>
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.<br/>
But after many ceremonies done,<br/>
He calls for wine: &lsquo;A health!&rsquo; quoth he, as if<br/>
He had been abroad, carousing to his mates<br/>
After a storm; quaff&rsquo;d off the muscadel,<br/>
And threw the sops all in the sexton&rsquo;s face,<br/>
Having no other reason<br/>
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly<br/>
And seem&rsquo;d to ask him sops as he was drinking.<br/>
This done, he took the bride about the neck,<br/>
And kiss&rsquo;d her lips with such a clamorous smack<br/>
That at the parting all the church did echo.<br/>
And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;<br/>
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.<br/>
Such a mad marriage never was before.<br/>
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.<br/>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all
foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray&rsquo;d? Was
ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are
coming after to warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof
of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to
thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.
Holla, ho! Curtis!</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
Who is that calls so coldly?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my
shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my
neck. A fire, good Curtis.</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
O, ay! Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no
water.</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
Is she so hot a shrew as she&rsquo;s reported?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou knowest
winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tamed my old
master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot; and so long
am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain
on thee to our mistress, whose hand,—she being now at hand,—
thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy
hot office?</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and
mistress are almost frozen to death.</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
There&rsquo;s fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Why, &lsquo;Jack boy! ho, boy!&rsquo; and as much news as wilt thou.<br/>
</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
Come, you are so full of cony-catching.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where&rsquo;s the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes
strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian,
their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, and carpets
laid, and everything in order?</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
First, know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fallen out.<br/>
</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
How?<br/>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a tale.<br/>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
This &rsquo;tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
And therefore &rsquo;tis called a sensible tale; and this cuff
was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening. Now I begin:
<i>Imprimis</i>, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my
mistress,—</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
Both of one horse?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
What&rsquo;s that to thee?<br/>
</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
Why, a horse.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me, thou
shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse;
thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was
bemoiled; how he left her with the horse upon her; how he beat me
because her horse stumbled; how she waded through the dirt to
pluck him off me: how he swore; how she prayed, that never prayed
before; how I cried; how the horses ran away; how her bridle was
burst; how I lost my crupper; with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to
thy grave.</p>

<p>CURTIS.<br/>
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>

Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow<br/>

That you are like to Sir Vincentio.<br/>
His name and credit shall you undertake,<br/>
And in my house you shall be friendly lodg&rsquo;d;<br/>
Look that you take upon you as you should!<br/>
You understand me, sir; so shall you stay<br/>
Till you have done your business in the city.<br/>
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.<br/>

Why, thou say&rsquo;st true; it is a paltry cap,<br/>
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;<br/>
I love thee well in that thou lik&rsquo;st it not.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;<br/>
And it I will have, or I will have none.<br/>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Thy gown? Why, ay: come, tailor, let us see&rsquo;t.<br/>
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?<br/>
What&rsquo;s this? A sleeve? &rsquo;Tis like a demi-cannon.<br/>
What, up and down, carv&rsquo;d like an apple tart?<br/>
Here&rsquo;s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,<br/>
Like to a censer in a barber&rsquo;s shop.<br/>
Why, what i&rsquo; devil&rsquo;s name, tailor, call&rsquo;st thou this?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
[<i>Aside</i>] I see she&rsquo;s like to have neither cap nor gown.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
You bid me make it orderly and well,<br/>
According to the fashion and the time.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Marry, and did; but if you be remember&rsquo;d,<br/>
I did not bid you mar it to the time.<br/>
Go, hop me over every kennel home,<br/>
For you shall hop without my custom, sir.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll none of it: hence! make your best of it.<br/>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
I never saw a better fashion&rsquo;d gown,<br/>
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;<br/>
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,<br/>
Thou thimble,<br/>
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!<br/>
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!<br/>
Brav&rsquo;d in mine own house with a skein of thread!<br/>
Away! thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,<br/>
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard<br/>
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv&rsquo;st!<br/>
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr&rsquo;d her gown.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
Your worship is deceiv&rsquo;d: the gown is made<br/>
Just as my master had direction.<br/>
Grumio gave order how it should be done.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
But how did you desire it should be made?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
But did you not request to have it cut?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Thou hast faced many things.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
I have.</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Face not me. Thou hast braved many men; brave not me: I
will neither be fac&rsquo;d nor brav&rsquo;d. I say unto thee, I bid thy
master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces:
ergo, thou liest.</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Read it.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
The note lies in &rsquo;s throat, if he say I said so.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
&rsquo;Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown.&rsquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it and
beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread; I said, a gown.
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Proceed.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
&rsquo;With a small compassed cape.&rsquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
I confess the cape.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
&rsquo;With a trunk sleeve.&rsquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
I confess two sleeves.<br/>
</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
&rsquo;The sleeves curiously cut.&rsquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Ay, there&rsquo;s the villainy.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Error i&rsquo; the bill, sir; error i&rsquo; the bill. I commanded the
sleeves should be cut out, and sew&rsquo;d up again; and that I&rsquo;ll
prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.</p>

<p>TAILOR.<br/>
This is true that I say; and I had thee in place where thou
shouldst know it.</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy
mete-yard, and spare not me.</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
You are i&rsquo; the right, sir; &rsquo;tis for my mistress.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Go, take it up unto thy master&rsquo;s use.<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress&rsquo; gown for
thy master&rsquo;s use!</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Why, sir, what&rsquo;s your conceit in that?<br/>
</p>

<p>GRUMIO.<br/>
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.<br/>
Take up my mistress&rsquo; gown to his master&rsquo;s use!<br/>
O fie, fie, fie!<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
[<i>Aside</i>]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.<br/>

O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse<br/>
For this poor furniture and mean array.<br/>

And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith,<br/>
To feast and sport us at thy father&rsquo;s house.<br/>
Go call my men, and let us straight to him;<br/>

&rsquo;Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,<br/>
With such austerity as &rsquo;longeth to a father.<br/>
</p>

<p>PEDANT.<br/>
I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;<br/>
&rsquo;Twere good he were school&rsquo;d.<br/>
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,<br/>
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.<br/>

Tut! fear not me.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
I told him that your father was at Venice,<br/>
And that you look&rsquo;d for him this day in Padua.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Th&rsquo;art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.<br/>
Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.<br/>
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">
Enter <span class="charname">Baptista</span> and <span class="charname">Lucentio.</span></p>

<p>Signior Baptista, you are happily met.<br/>
[<i>To the Pedant</i>] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;<br/>
I pray you stand good father to me now;<br/>
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.<br/>
</p>

<p>PEDANT.<br/>
Soft, son!<br/>
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua<br/>
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio<br/>
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause<br/>
Of love between your daughter and himself:<br/>
And,—for the good report I hear of you,<br/>
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,<br/>
And she to him,—to stay him not too long,<br/>
I am content, in a good father&rsquo;s care,<br/>
To have him match&rsquo;d; and, if you please to like<br/>
No worse than I, upon some agreement<br/>
Me shall you find ready and willing<br/>
With one consent to have her so bestow&rsquo;d;<br/>
For curious I cannot be with you,<br/>
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.<br/>
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.<br/>
Right true it is your son Lucentio here<br/>
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,<br/>
Or both dissemble deeply their affections;<br/>
And therefore, if you say no more than this,<br/>
That like a father you will deal with him,<br/>
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,<br/>
The match is made, and all is done:<br/>
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best<br/>
We be affied, and such assurance ta&rsquo;en<br/>
As shall with either part&rsquo;s agreement stand?<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know<br/>
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;<br/>
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still,<br/>
And happily we might be interrupted.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Then at my lodging, and it like you:<br/>
There doth my father lie; and there this night<br/>
We&rsquo;ll pass the business privately and well.<br/>
Send for your daughter by your servant here;<br/>
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.<br/>
The worst is this, that at so slender warning<br/>
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,<br/>
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;<br/>
And, if you will, tell what hath happened:<br/>
Lucentio&rsquo;s father is arriv&rsquo;d in Padua,<br/>
And how she&rsquo;s like to be Lucentio&rsquo;s wife.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart!<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.<br/>
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?<br/>
Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;<br/>
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
What say&rsquo;st thou, Biondello?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Biondello, what of that?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound
the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
I pray thee moralize them.<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the
deceiving father of a deceitful son.</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
And what of him?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
And then?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
The old priest at Saint Luke&rsquo;s church is at your
command at all hours.</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
And what of all this?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance. Take
your assurance of her, <i>cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum</i>; to the church! take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses.<br/>
If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,<br/>
But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Going.</i>]</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Hear&rsquo;st thou, Biondello?<br/>
</p>

<p>BIONDELLO.<br/>
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an afternoon
as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so
may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to
go to Saint Luke&rsquo;s to bid the priest be ready to come against you
come with your appendix.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
I may, and will, if she be so contented.<br/>
She will be pleas&rsquo;d; then wherefore should I doubt?<br/>
Hap what hap may, I&rsquo;ll roundly go about her;<br/>
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her:<br/>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but

His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him
up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.</p>

Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine
only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.</p>

Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold on
him, I charge you, in the Duke&rsquo;s name. O, my son, my son! Tell

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:<br/>
And time it is when raging war is done,<br/>
To smile at &rsquo;scapes and perils overblown.<br/>
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,<br/>
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.<br/>
Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,<br/>
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,<br/>
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:<br/>
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,<br/>
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;<br/>
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>They sit at table.</i>]</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
For both our sakes I would that word were true.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.<br/>
</p>

<p>WIDOW.<br/>
Then never trust me if I be afeard.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:<br/>
I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.<br/>
</p>

<p>WIDOW.<br/>
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Roundly replied.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
Mistress, how mean you that?<br/>
</p>

<p>WIDOW.<br/>
Thus I conceive by him.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
My widow says thus she conceives her tale.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
&rsquo;He that is giddy thinks the world turns round&rsquo;:<br/>
I pray you tell me what you meant by that.<br/>
</p>

<p>WIDOW.<br/>
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,<br/>
Measures my husband&rsquo;s sorrow by his woe;<br/>
And now you know my meaning.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
A very mean meaning.<br/>
</p>

<p>WIDOW.<br/>
Right, I mean you.<br/>
</p>

<p>KATHERINA.<br/>
And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.<br/>

<p>GREMIO.<br/>
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.<br/>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Head and butt! An hasty-witted body<br/>
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.<br/>

<p>VINCENTIO.<br/>
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken&rsquo;d you?<br/>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I&rsquo;ll sleep again.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,<br/>
Have at you for a bitter jest or two.<br/>
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,<br/>
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.<br/>
You are welcome all.<br/>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio;<br/>
This bird you aim&rsquo;d at, though you hit her not:<br/>
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss&rsquo;d.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
O, sir! Lucentio slipp&rsquo;d me like his greyhound,<br/>
Which runs himself, and catches for his master.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
A good swift simile, but something currish.<br/>
</p>

<p>TRANIO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:<br/>
&rsquo;Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
A has a little gall&rsquo;d me, I confess;<br/>
And as the jest did glance away from me,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis ten to one it maim&rsquo;d you two outright.<br/>
</p>

<p>BAPTISTA.<br/>
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,<br/>
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,<br/>
Let&rsquo;s each one send unto his wife,<br/>
And he whose wife is most obedient,<br/>
To come at first when he doth send for her,<br/>
Shall win the wager which we will propose.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORTENSIO.<br/>
Content. What&rsquo;s the wager?<br/>
</p>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
Twenty crowns.<br/>
</p>

<p>PETRUCHIO.<br/>
Twenty crowns!<br/>
I&rsquo;ll venture so much of my hawk or hound,<br/>
But twenty times so much upon my wife.<br/>

<p>LUCENTIO.<br/>
A hundred then.<br/>

Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,<br/>
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes<br/>
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:<br/>
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,<br/>
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,<br/>
And in no sense is meet or amiable.<br/>
A woman mov&rsquo;d is like a fountain troubled,<br/>
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;<br/>
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty<br/>
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.<br/>
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,<br/>
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,<br/>
And for thy maintenance commits his body<br/>
To painful labour both by sea and land,<br/>
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,<br/>
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;<br/>
And craves no other tribute at thy hands<br/>
But love, fair looks, and true obedience;<br/>
Too little payment for so great a debt.<br/>
Such duty as the subject owes the prince,<br/>
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;<br/>
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,<br/>
And not obedient to his honest will,<br/>
What is she but a foul contending rebel<br/>
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?—<br/>
I am asham&rsquo;d that women are so simple<br/>
To offer war where they should kneel for peace,<br/>
Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,<br/>
When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.<br/>
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,<br/>
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,<br/>
But that our soft conditions and our hearts<br/>
Should well agree with our external parts?<br/>
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!<br/>
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,<br/>
My heart as great, my reason haply more,<br/>
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;<br/>
But now I see our lances are but straws,<br/>
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,<br/>
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.<br/>
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,<br/>
And place your hands below your husband&rsquo;s foot:<br/>
In token of which duty, if he please,<br/>
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.<br/>

Project Gutenberg volunteers


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
